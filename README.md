# American Concrete Institute (ACI)-UIUC Student Chapter
A repo for the Python workshop for ACI-UIUC (April 6, 2019)

This workshop will cover basic and advanced concepts of programming using the latest version of Python 3.x on IPython/Jupyter Notebooks. For instructions, please see the notes.pdf file.

## Installing Python
The easiest and **recommended** way to get all popular Python libraries and IDEs is by downloading and installing the latest [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for your computer. Make sure to download the latest version corresponding to Python 3.x.

Alternatively, you can install and use Python using the terminal: 

- On Windows 10, activate [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- On Mac OS or any UNIX-like OS (such as Linux), just run your favorite Terminal application

Then install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) with pip. With any other version of Windows (which you should not be using for too long on your personal computers anyway for security reasons), Anaconda is your best option.

## Running a Notebooks
If you installed Anaconda, open the Anaconda Prompt, navigate to your directory, and use the `jupyter notebook` command. If you choose to use the terminal, follow the same steps on the terminal. Both methods will launch Jupyter Notebooks in your browser.
