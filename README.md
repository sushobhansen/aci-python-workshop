# IAHR and IWRA UIUC Student Chapters
A repo for the Python workshop for IAHR and IWRA UIUC Student Chapters (October 5, 2019)

This workshop will cover basic and advanced concepts of programming using the latest version of Python 3.x on IPython/Jupyter Notebooks. For instructions, please see the notes.pdf file.

## Installing Python
The easiest and **recommended** way to get all popular Python libraries and IDEs is by downloading and installing the latest [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for your computer. Make sure to download the latest version corresponding to Python 3.x.

Alternatively, you can install and use Python using the terminal: 

- On Windows 10, activate [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- On Mac OS or any UNIX-like OS (such as Linux), just run your favorite Terminal application

Then install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) with `pip`. With any other version of Windows (which you should not be using for too long on your personal computers anyway for security reasons), Anaconda is your best option.

## Running a Notebook
If you installed Anaconda, open the Anaconda Prompt, navigate to your directory, and use the `jupyter notebook` command. If you choose to use the terminal, follow the same steps on the terminal. Both methods will launch Jupyter Notebooks in your browser. From there, you can create a new Notebook.

## Running Python Remotely
If you prefer not to install anything on your computer but would rather run Python remotely from your browser, you can use the Online IDE from [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3). This doesn't always work very well though. Any other online IDE that you find should be OK too.
